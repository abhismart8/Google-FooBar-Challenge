# Google-FooBar-Challenge
What is Google Foobar Challenge?
Its a secret portal which was created by Google in 2015 for programmers who can solve difficult problems and like challenges in programming, so that google can hire them 
through this.
This portal is not something you can find just like that, you will need to trigger it somehow.

SO, let me tell you how :

Type "c++ move semantics" without quotes, and you will find the page is getting a bit inverted and then you will see a message by Google, click on "I want to Play" button, 
and then boom you are inside and ready to roll.

Hope you find this interesting and spread the work to your fellow programming geeks, Cheers!
